# langton
> langton ant. 

dead simple, dirty code, but working.
-------
run npm install

then node index.js 

then open localhost:9091 and press the buttons.

------

You can change the speed, the size of 'pixels', the pct of white in langton.js:
default: 
```
time = 0, //time between two loops
drawSize = 2, //2pixels to draw a square
loop = 0, //How many loops until now? 0 is normal, don't touch it.
pctWhite = 60, //percentage of white in the primary map.
```

----
the ant cannot go outside the map. Could be nice to allow it to do so, like to create more map if the ant need to.
