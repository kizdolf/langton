V2: Much much faster, change stackLoop to slow down / speedUp and to not crash your browser.
-------
run npm install

then node index.js

then open localhost:9091 and press the buttons.

------

You can change the speed, the size of 'pixels', the pct of white  and more. But changing white percent (100% by default) or the map size will fore the re-creaction of the map.

----
the ant cannot go outside the map. So if she does I just put her back in the center.
